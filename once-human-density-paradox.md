# The Density Paradox: Why Once Human's Public Events Feel Empty

## The Problem: Discovery Solved, Incentive Absent

Recent UI improvements added Real-time Recommendations with direct teleport, event timers, and share functionality. Discovery friction is largely solved—players can see active PCEs across worlds and teleport instantly.

Yet events remain empty. Why?

**Discovery ≠ Density.** Seeing "Paradise Lost - High Risk" is active doesn't guarantee anyone's there. When you teleport, will you find 15 players or stand alone? The UI shows events exist; it doesn't show crowd size or guarantee company.

**Discovery ≠ Incentive.** Even with perfect visibility, why teleport? The rewards (Stellar Planula, mod crates, materials) are identical whether 1 player or 20 completes the event. On permanent servers with 20,000+ acid stockpiled, resource rewards lose meaning. The remaining draw is mods—which drop from basically everything else (Monoliths, Silos, rift objectives). No differentiation.

**The Social Initiator Tax.** Combat Invitation lets players share clickable teleport links. But sharing confirms only that *you'll* be there—not that others will join. The person who shares bears the social risk of a dead engagement. Most don't bother.

### Free Cosmetics Exist—They're Not Compelling

Once Human offers free cosmetics through login rewards, currency accumulation, and Battle Pass free tiers. These aren't compelling because:

- **Predictable acquisition:** Log in X days, accumulate Y currency, redeem
- **Zero RNG/luck element:** Everyone who completes the threshold gets the same item
- **No status signal:** "I logged in during the event" isn't a story worth telling

Players don't grind events hoping for lucky drops—they complete the predictable steps and move on.

### The Black Box Problem

OH's gameplay reward systems operate as black boxes. Mod drop rates, deviation capture odds, formula drop chances—none are documented. Community wikis can't build hunting cultures around items with unknown odds. This creates distrust ("Is RNG bugged or am I unlucky?"), disengagement (why grind when you can't calculate expected runs?), and zero community knowledge-sharing.

Note: OH *does* document paid gacha rates (Lightforge pity systems)—likely legally required. But gameplay drops remain opaque, which is precisely where community engagement would form.

Contrast with FO76: the Fasnacht Rare Mask (~0.3% drop rate) spawned years of Reddit threads, farming guides, trading economies, and "Got it!" posts generating FOMO. Transparency transforms grinding from frustration into calculable pursuit.

## FO76's Model: Dual Economy + Automatic Density

### Paid Shop Coexists with Event Drops

Fallout 76 has a thriving premium shop (Atom Shop) AND RNG-based event-exclusive drops. Fasnacht alone offers rare masks (~0.3%) plus exclusive camp furniture. These aren't either/or—players buy shop items AND grind event drops:

| Path | Psychology | Player Says |
|------|------------|-------------|
| Paid cosmetics | Convenience, "I want this NOW" | "Worth $15 to look good today" |
| Grind drops | Status, luck/effort story | "I ran Fasnacht 200 times for this mask" |

The grind path doesn't cannibalize paid sales—it creates engagement that keeps players in-game longer, encountering more purchase opportunities.

### Single-World Architecture = Automatic Density

FO76's public events work because **every player in a session sees the same events simultaneously.**

- 24 players per world instance (not fragmented across 10 sub-worlds)
- Event spawns → all 24 receive identical notification
- Free fast travel to active events
- Result: Radiation Rumble reliably pulls 8-20 players

When Fasnacht runs hourly, players KNOW: (1) the event exists, (2) rare masks might drop, (3) the server will be crowded. All three conditions = organic mass participation.

**The math:** FO76's smaller instance (24 players, single world) produces higher effective density than OH's larger servers (thousands fragmented across 10 worlds with per-world event spawning).

## The Proposal: Chase Items + Density Architecture

### Add PCE-Exclusive Drops with Transparent Rates

**Addressing "RNG-hate":** OH's Mitsuko marks system serves players who prefer predictable progression. RNG drops don't replace this—they add a complementary layer. Predictable paths reward commitment over months; RNG paths make each session potentially memorable. FO76 has both (Gold Bullion grinding AND rare event drops). The "I got lucky!" moment generates social proof that "I accumulated 500 marks" doesn't. Both systems needed; OH currently has only the first.

**What to add:**
- **Apparel:** Scenario-exclusive outfits (0.3-1% drop), documented rates
- **Territory Formulas:** Event-exclusive furniture/decorations, functional variants

### Density Architecture (Goal, Not Prescription)

We don't know Starry's tech stack. But the player experience goal is clear:

**Current state:** I see event → I teleport → I'm alone → Normal tier completion → resources I don't need → I don't bother next time

**Target state:** I see event → I teleport → 10+ players already there → Legend tier → chance at rare drops → I come back every time

How Starry achieves this (world merging, cross-world instances, population-based spawning) is their domain. The requirement: **when I show up, others are there.**

### Bonus: Scenario-Exclusive Drops Create Return Incentive

Why return to Manibus after exhausting its content? Currently: no reason. With scenario-exclusive drops, players return when new chase items are added or to farm ultra-rares they missed. Cross-character cosmetic sharing (March 2025) amplifies this—drops benefit your whole account. Engagement surges without developer content costs.

### Why This Grows Paid Revenue

Adding grind-path cosmetics doesn't cannibalize shop sales:

1. **Time-in-game increases:** Players grinding events encounter more shop exposure
2. **Different buyer psychology:** "Grind for status" and "pay for convenience" serve different needs—often in the same player
3. **Social spending unlocked:** Shared-benefit consumables (FO76's Lunchboxes grant +25% XP to ALL nearby players) only work with crowds—density enables social monetization
4. **Goodwill monetization:** Players who feel the model is fair spend more willingly

Warframe has sustained profitability for over a decade while letting players grind or trade for nearly everything. The grind path creates engaged players; engaged players become paying players.

## Implementation Realities

### We Understand the Constraints

FO76's model works because CAMPs are instanced and relocatable. OH's fixed territory plots in a shared persistent world make direct replication impossible—dynamic instancing would break territory persistence, a core identity feature.

However: permanent servers already represent a design philosophy evolution. Starry proved willingness to experiment with the seasonal→permanent graduation model. The challenge now is finding the sweetspot for coexistence.

### Tiered Options (Least to Most Ambitious)

**Option A + B — Incremental Gains (Low lift):**
- **A:** Add exclusive drops + transparent rates. Creates incentive to go regardless of crowd.
- **B:** Show real-time player counts on event UI ("Paradise Lost - 12 players active"). Removes crowd uncertainty.

Together, these may shift participation incrementally. They work within existing architecture and require no philosophical changes. But they don't solve the underlying population fragmentation—if 50 players are spread across 10 worlds, A+B makes each more likely to act, but can't manufacture density from thin population.

**Option C — True Density Architecture (High lift, Permanent Servers Only):**
The FO76-like experience—teleport and reliably find crowds—requires architectural change. Permanent servers may be the right sandbox: they're already the "experimental" track, player expectations differ from seasonal progression, and territory persistence is the main constraint to navigate. ESO and GW2 megaservers prove dynamic population management works in MMOs. This is a larger conversation, but if A+B prove insufficient, permanent servers could pilot something bolder.

### Precedent Exists

| Game | Housing Model | Density Solution |
|------|---------------|------------------|
| ESO | Fully instanced | Megaserver dynamically layers zones |
| GW2 | Instanced | Map instances merge by population |
| New World | Open-world territories | Server merges (struggled) |

OH's combination (fixed territories + static worlds + seasonal graduation) is somewhat unique. But the density problem isn't—and other MMOs have solved it with dynamic population management. The question is which approach fits OH's identity.

## Summary

| Element | Current OH | Proposed OH | FO76 Reference |
|---------|------------|-------------|----------------|
| Event discovery | ✓ Solved (new UI) | — | ✓ |
| Crowd guarantee | ✗ Fragmented worlds | Density architecture | ✓ Single-world |
| Chase cosmetics | ✗ Wallet-only | RNG event drops | ✓ Rare masks |
| Chase formulas | ✗ Wallet-only | RNG event drops | ✓ Camp plans |
| Drop transparency | ✗ Black box | Published rates | ✓ Wiki culture |

**The ask:** Add RNG-based, content-exclusive, transparently-documented chase items (apparel + territory formulas) to PCEs, combined with architecture that guarantees crowds when events spawn.

**The outcome:** Players have reasons to show up (exclusive drops) AND confidence others will be there (density design). Both conditions together—not either alone—create the organic event participation FO76 demonstrates.
